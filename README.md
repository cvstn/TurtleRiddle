# TurtleRiddle

This is a Turtle Riddle.

The questions and answers aren't necessarily related to Turtles.

The reward for completing each step is the private keys for a TRTL wallet.

The wallet reward in each step as twice as much TRTL as the previous step.

The rewards are first-come first-serve.

Now, some very important rules and suggestions.

Files are fragile. Broken files might not contain any answers.

Any required software is available for free. No required software is provided.

Each branch has exactly one working solution.

The solution to each branch is the password to the next branch.

Except the password gets written twice.

No ,.? #$@!'etc in answers. No CAPS in answers. No 123 in answers. No onehundredtwentythree in answers.

Some examples:

"123" should be written as onetwothreeonetwothree as a password.

"Gustavus Adolphus" should be written as gustavusadolphusgustavusadolphus as a password.

"You're the best!" should be written as yourethebestyourethebest as a password.

Disseminating answers to the general public goes against the spirit of the game.

The password for the first branch is turtleturtle
